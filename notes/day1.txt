To create virtual environment in python
python -m venv . --> -m = module
Activate it
source bin/activate --> linux
.\Scripts\activate --> Windows

Install django
pip install django==3.1.2

First create a project
django-admin startproject bootcamp .

Now we need to create an app. App is like a component of a website
2 ways to create it
django-admin startapp products
or
python manage.py startapp products --> preffered

Now go to products folder (app we just created)
Lets assume this is database.It has a table with colums id,title,price
we add these in a class

after creating apps, you should add it to settings.py
Then run 
python manage.py makemigratitions 
python manage.py migrate 
This creates a database model

After creating model, for admin access,you have to register it in admin.py

Then create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

Run server
python manage.py runserver

In database to create objects,we can use django-admin(WebUI).Its for non-developers
As a developer,you use shell

>>> from producti.models import Product
>>> Product.objects.create(title='Raspberry Pi') 
<Product: Product object (1)>
>>> Product.objects.create(title='Turing Pi')    
<Product: Product object (2)>
>>> Product.objects.get(id=2)                 
<Product: Product object (2)>
>>> Product.objects.create(title='Turing Pi',price=20) 
<Product: Product object (3)>
>>> Product.objects.create(title='Arduino',discount=False)    
<Product: Product object (4)>

Updating object
>>> obj = Product.objects.get(id=1)
>>> obj.price = 67
>>> obj.save()
>>> obj.delete() --> To delete object

// bulk_create() To create lot of users. Check it up
