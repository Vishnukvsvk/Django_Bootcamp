We use templates to render html in views

First we have to create templates folder and add required html files in it.
Then go to settings.py and add the directory to DIR list

In views.py,
def Home_View(request):
  return render(request,"home.html,{}") --> third argument is a dictionary

To make html dynamic,
def Home_View(request, *args, **kwargs):
    # return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello Vishnu</h1>")
    context = {"name": "vishnu Kumar Kvs", "city": "Bangalore"}
    return render(request, "home.html", context)
In home.html
<h2>I am {{name}} and live in {{city}}</h2>

Blocks in django
You can create a base.html and extend it and use it in any html doc

First,it will check templates folder in project level,next it checks inside app
