HTTP Methods

GET       -   Retrive
POST      -   Create (also update)
PUT       -   Update
DELETE    -   Destroy

Every view gets a request and these request have HTTP methods

request.GET , request.POST --> {"some":"data"}
request.method == "POST", request.method=="GET" --> True/False

For POST method, you can use form tag in html.
<form method="POST" action=".">
    <input type="text" />
    <button type="submit">Send Data</button>   
</form>
But this is not at all preferred

Another legit way is to use django forms
